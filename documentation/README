The ActiveWarehouse documentation is written in Textile format and processed with the convert.rb script. This script will convert the Textile to HTML and will insert a TOC in each document, exporting the final result to HTML.

To run convert.rb:

  ./convert.rb file.txt

This would produce:

  file.txt.html
